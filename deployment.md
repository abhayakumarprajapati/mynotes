# How other teammates will work ? 

1. Teammate generates their own SSH key pair

On their computer, they run:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f my-teammate-key

This creates:

my-teammate-key (private key)

my-teammate-key.pub (public key)

They send only the .pub file to you.

2. You add their public key to EC2
SSH into your EC2 instance (via PuTTY).

Run:

sudo su
cd /home/ec2-user/.ssh
nano authorized_keys

3. Paste your teammateâ€™s public key (.pub file content) on a new line.

4. Save and exit (Ctrl + O, then Ctrl + X).

5. Set correct permissions (just to be safe):

chmod 600 authorized_keys
chown ec2-user:ec2-user authorized_keys

Teammate connects using their private key:

They use:

Hostname/IP of the EC2

Username: ec2-user

Private key: their my-teammate-key (converted to .ppk for PuTTY/WinSCP if needed)
