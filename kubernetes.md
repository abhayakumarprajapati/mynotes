ðŸš€ What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications (like Docker containers).

ðŸ§  Why should a full stack dev learn Kubernetes?
Deploy your apps more reliably and repeatably

Scale your services easily (handle more users/load)

Manage microservices architecture effectively

Integrate with CI/CD pipelines

Prepare for cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)

ðŸ§± Core Concepts (Simplified for Full Stack Developers):
Concept =>	What it is (Simplified)
Pod =>	Smallest deployable unit in K8s (usually 1 container, sometimes more)
Node =>	A physical or virtual machine in your cluster
Cluster =>	A set of Nodes managed by Kubernetes
Deployment =>	Defines how to deploy/update pods (like your React + Express app)
Service =>	Provides a stable IP and DNS name to access your app (e.g., frontend â†” backend)
ConfigMap/Secret=>	Store environment variables or sensitive configs
Volume =>	Persistent storage for your containers
Ingress =>	Route external HTTP traffic to your services (like a reverse proxy + load balancer)

ðŸ“¦ Example Use Case (React + Node.js App):
Letâ€™s say you built a MERN app.

Dockerize your app (create Dockerfiles for frontend and backend)

Create Kubernetes Deployments for both

Use Services so frontend can talk to backend

Expose app to the internet using Ingress

Scale your app with kubectl scale deployment

ðŸ”§ Tools Youâ€™ll Use with Kubernetes:

kubectl â€“ CLI to manage Kubernetes resources

Minikube â€“ Run Kubernetes locally

Helm â€“ Kubernetes package manager (like npm for K8s configs)

Docker â€“ Still needed to containerize your app

ðŸŽ¯ How to Get Started:
Learn Docker first (if not already)

Set up Minikube or use Play with Kubernetes

Try deploying a simple Node.js app

Learn basic kubectl commands

Understand YAML files (deployment.yaml, service.yaml)

Try a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions + K8s)
