# Streams in nodejs
Streams in Node.js are a way to handle reading or writing data efficiently, especially for large files or real-time data processing. Streams work with chunks of data rather than loading everything into memory, making them memory-efficient and fast.

Types of Streams in Node.js:
Readable Streams â€“ Used for reading data.

Writable Streams â€“ Used for writing data.

Duplex Streams â€“ Can read and write data (e.g., sockets).

Transform Streams â€“ A type of Duplex stream that can modify data as it passes through (e.g., compression, encryption).

1. Readable Stream
Example: Reading a file using a stream.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const fs = require('fs');

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log('Received chunk:', chunk);
});

readableStream.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Finished reading');
});

2. Writable Stream
Example: Writing to a file using a stream.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const fs = require('fs');

const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writableStream.write('Hello, this is a writable stream!\n');
writableStream.end('Writing completed.');

writableStream.on('finish', () => {
    console.log('Finished writing to file');
});

3. Piping Readable to Writable
Example: Copying a file efficiently using a pipe.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const fs = require('fs');

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

writableStream.on('finish', () => {
    console.log('File copied successfully');
});

4. Transform Stream (Compression)
Example: Compressing a file using zlib.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const fs = require('fs');
const zlib = require('zlib');

const gzip = zlib.createGzip();
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('input.txt.gz');

readableStream.pipe(gzip).pipe(writableStream);

writableStream.on('finish', () => {
    console.log('File compressed successfully');
});
When to Use Streams?
Processing large files (e.g., reading/writing logs).

Streaming real-time data (e.g., audio/video).

Efficient handling of network requests (e.g., sending files over HTTP).

Would you like an example of using streams in an HTTP server or something else? ğŸš€


# Rate limiting in nodejs

***You can implement rate limiting in an Express application using the express-rate-limit middleware. This helps prevent abuse and protects your API from excessive requests by setting a limit on the number of requests a client can make within a specified time frame***

1. Apply Rate Limiting in Your Express App
npm install express-rate-limit


const express = require("express");
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const app = express();

// Define the rate limiter middleware
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: { error: "Too many requests, please try again later." },
  standardHeaders: true, // Return rate limit info in headers
  legacyHeaders: false, // Disable X-RateLimit-* headers
});

// Apply the rate limiter to all requests
app.use(limiter);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to the Express API");
});

const PORT = 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

2. Apply Rate Limiting to Specific Routes

const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 login attempts per window
  message: { error: "Too many login attempts, please try again later." },
});

app.post("/login", loginLimiter, (req, res) => {
  res.send("Login route");
});
