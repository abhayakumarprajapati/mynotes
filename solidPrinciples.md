The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented software development, aimed at making code more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Here's a breakdown of each principle:

S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Definition: A class should have only one reason to change.

Meaning: Each class should do one thing and do it well. If a class handles multiple responsibilities, changes to one responsibility could affect others.

Example: Don’t mix file handling logic with business logic in the same class.

O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Definition: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Meaning: You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

Example: Use interfaces or abstract classes so you can add new implementations without modifying existing ones.

L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Definition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

Meaning: Subclasses should behave like their parent classes when used interchangeably.

Example: If class Bird has a method fly(), a subclass Penguin should not override it in a way that breaks the expectations of the method (since penguins can't fly).

I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Definition: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Meaning: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that implementing classes only need to worry about the methods they actually use.

Example: Don’t force a class to implement unnecessary methods just because they exist on a bulky interface.

D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Meaning: Code should depend on interfaces or abstract classes, not concrete implementations.

Example: Instead of hardcoding a class to use a specific logger, inject a logger interface it can depend on.
