Learning system design thoroughly involves understanding both foundational concepts and practical implementation. Here's a complete, structured roadmap to learn system design from beginner to advanced:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Understand the Basics
Start with the fundamental concepts:

What is system design?

Difference between HLD (High-Level Design) & LLD (Low-Level Design)

Scalability, Availability, Reliability, Maintainability

ðŸ“˜ Resources:

Grokking the System Design Interview (paid but popular)

YouTube: Tech Dummies Narayan, Gaurav Sen

ðŸ”¹ 2. Study Key Components
Learn how these work and how theyâ€™re used in real systems:

Component	Topics
Load Balancer	L4 vs L7, HAProxy, NGINX
Caching	Redis, Memcached, CDN
Database	SQL vs NoSQL, Sharding, Replication
Message Queues	Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS
Storage	Blob storage (S3), file systems
Data Models	Relational, Document, Key-value
Rate Limiting	Token bucket, Leaky bucket

ðŸ”¹ 3. Learn Networking Fundamentals
Understand what happens when a request travels from browser to server:

HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, TCP/IP

REST vs WebSocket

CDN, Reverse Proxy

ðŸ”¹ 4. Explore Architectural Patterns
Familiarize yourself with real-world system architectures:

Monolith vs Microservices

Event-Driven Architecture

CQRS & Event Sourcing

CAP Theorem & Consistency Models

ðŸ”¹ 5. Practice Designing Real Systems
Try designing these systems from scratch:

System	Focus
URL Shortener	Hashing, DB writes, Redirects
Instagram	Media storage, feed generation
WhatsApp	Messaging queue, delivery guarantee
YouTube	Video encoding, streaming
Uber	Real-time location, matching algorithm

ðŸ“˜ Use System Design Primer on GitHub for examples.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Mock Interviews & Whiteboarding
Practice explaining your design to others.

Use tools like Excalidraw, Whimsical, or just pen-paper.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Advanced Concepts
Distributed systems: Paxos, Raft, Consistent Hashing

Kubernetes & Docker (for deployment design)

Observability: Logging, Monitoring, Tracing

âœ… Tips:
Think in terms of requirements (scale, users, latency).

Always justify your choices (e.g., why Redis? why sharding?).

Learn trade-offs (e.g., SQL vs NoSQL).
